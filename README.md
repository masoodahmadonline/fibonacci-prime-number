# Question: 
In the Fibonacci series, type the code that gives the difference between the largest prime number
smaller than 500,000 and the smallest prime number greater than 500,000.

# Solution and comments:
I have attached two solution styles for the same question. First one has capabilities to be improved for re-usability (e.g method to get next or previous fibonacci can be created) and modular code (I prefer it). The second is short and simple (some people prefer this)
